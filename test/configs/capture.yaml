# This is an example configuration provided by Wraith.
# Feel free to amend for your own requirements.

# This particular config is intended to demonstrate how
# to use Wraith in 'capture' mode, which is best suited to
# comparing a test and live version of the same website.
#
# `wraith capture capture.yaml`

# (required) The engine to run Wraith with. Examples: 'phantomjs', 'casperjs', 'slimerjs'
# browser: "phantomjs"
browser: "casperjs"

# (required) The domains to take screenshots of.
domains:
  current:  "http://localhost:8080"
  new:      "http://localhost:8080"

# (required) The paths to capture. All paths should exist for both of the domains specified above.
paths: 
   styleguide_home:
    path: /
   component_buttons:
    path: /components.html
    selector: 'div:nth-child(5)'

# (required) Screen widths (and optional height) to resize the browser to before taking the screenshot.
# Breakpoints based on Bootstrap 4's grid + 1024 (sm, md, l, 1024, xl)
screen_widths:
  - 544
  - 768 
  - 992 
  - 1024
  - 1200

# (optional) JavaScript file to execute before taking screenshot of every path. Default: nil
# before_capture: 'test/javascript/disable_javascript--phantom.js'
before_capture: 'test/javascript/wait--casper.js'

# (required) The directory that your screenshots will be stored in
directory: 'test/shots'

# (required) Amount of fuzz ImageMagick will use when comparing images. A higher fuzz makes the comparison less strict.
fuzz: '20%'

# (optional) The maximum acceptable level of difference (in %) between two images before Wraith reports a failure. Default: 0
threshold: 5

# (optional) Specify the template (and generated thumbnail sizes) for the gallery output.

  thumb_width:  200
  thumb_height: 200

# (optional) Choose which results are displayed in the gallery, and in what order. Default: alphanumeric
# Options:
#   alphanumeric - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by path
#   diffs_first - all paths (with or without a difference) are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
#   diffs_only - only paths with a difference are shown, sorted by difference size (largest first)
# Note: different screen widths are always grouped together.
mode: diffs_first
